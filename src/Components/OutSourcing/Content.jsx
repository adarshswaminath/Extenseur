                        More the Employees, this math gets a lot more attractive!!! Outsourcing helps to reduce the cost of your back office needs by forming an off-the-space department of highly trained and experience staff. This small bussiness will make it more cost effective running which can fucntion as the same as your team without an additional expansion to a larger location or another department. Companies that sucessfully create and sustain value year after year are rare. Many try to but only one in 10 achieved sustained profitable growth. One activity that sets such winners apart, they often use capability sourcing in more innovatives ways than the competitors

                        Outsourcing and offshoring began as cost-cutting measure,but comapanies that create real sustained value routinely use them for far more strategic ends to gain capablities that they don't have in house or to strengthen capabilities they do have.Those winners use capability sourcing broadly and strategically for everything from developing world class talent to bringing new products to market faster and enabling bussiness model innovation,in other words they have moved way beyond more cost cutting.You can get your job done at a lower cost and at better quality as well.Due to the difference in wages between western countries and Asia the same kind of work that is done over there can be done in India at a fraction of the cost.There is a cost savings of around 60% by outsourcing your work to India,Plus the quality of the service provider is high thereby ensuring that low cost does not mean low quality
